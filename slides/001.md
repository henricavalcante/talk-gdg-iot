    The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT) is the network of physical objects or
    "things"  embedded with electronics,  software,  sensors,  and network
    connectivity,  which  enables  these objects  to  collect and exchange
    data.


      "Ubiquitous computing  names  the  third  wave in computing, just
       now beginning.  First  were   mainframes, each shared by lots of
       people.  Now we  are in  the personal computing era,  person and
       machine staring uneasily at each other across  the desktop. Next
       comes ubiquitous computing, or the  age of calm technology, when
       technology recedes into the background of our lives."

                                                          - Mark Waiser
